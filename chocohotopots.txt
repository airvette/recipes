Place a baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 400 degrees F.

Butter the ramekins with 1 tablespoon butter.

Either in a microwave or in a bowl suspended over a pan over simmering water,
melt the dark chocolate and 1 stick butter, then set aside to cool a little.

In another bowl, mix the eggs with the sugar and flour with a hand whisk and
beat in the cooled butter and chocolate mixture. Divide the mixture between the
4 buttered ramekins. Bake for about 20 minutes, by which time the tops will be
cooked and cracked and the chocolate gooey underneath.

Place each ramekin on a small plate with a teaspoon and serve. Make sure to warn
  people that these desserts will be HOT!
